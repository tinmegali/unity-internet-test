# Unity Internet Connection Test
This small project checks if an internet connection is available.

The test adapts itself according to the platform it is running on.

## Inspiration
I had some problems testing connection on Android devices and decided to share my solution. Feel free to use it and adapt it as you please.

## How to use it
- Download the release em import it to your Unity project
- Or clone the classes direct on your Unity project. 

## Tested on
- Unity Editor
- Windows 10
- Android 16

## TODO
- Test and adapt on iOS
- Test and adapt on Linux
